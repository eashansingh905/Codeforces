# Codeforces

HI ALL, this repository is for my solutions to the Codeforces problems that can be found at https://codeforces.com/problemset.
I have sectioned the problems based off difficulty so if you need to find a specific problem, you can open the folder for a respective
difficulty level. Since the folders can be quite big, I reccomend you press Cntrl + F and search by the name of the problem. 

These are my solutions to the problems and by no means are the "best" or only way to solve them. A lot of my programs have evolved to be
more efficient over time, so I do not expect all programs to be perfect. These programs were put up soley for those who wish to see a 
different approach to a problem or for those who need help getting started with developing their own solution.

I highly reccomend improving upon my solutions and trying to make them more simple. 

*NOTE: I am currently focusing on Difficulty Level 800 Problems
